# 🚀 Cloud Platform and Collaboration ProjectThis is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

**Introduction to Cloud Computing - Final Project**

## Getting Started

## 📖 Overview

First, run the development server:

This project implements a **cloud-based file storage and collaboration platform** that enables users to upload, manage, and collaborate on files with version control and secure access. Built with modern cloud technologies, it demonstrates containerization, orchestration, database management, and automated backup systems.

```bash

### The Problem We Solvenpm run dev

In collaborative environments, teams need a reliable way to:# or

- Store and share files securelyyarn dev

- Track changes with version history# or

- Manage user permissions and access controlpnpm dev

- Ensure data persistence and disaster recovery# or

- Scale resources based on demandbun dev

```

### Key Features

- **User Authentication & Role Management** - Secure login with role-based permissionsOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

- **File Upload & Version Control** - Track file changes and restore previous versions

- **Metadata & Tagging System** - Organize files with tags and commentsYou can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

- **Automated Database Backups** - Regular backups to DigitalOcean Spaces

- **Containerized Deployment** - Docker & Docker Compose for easy deploymentThis project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

- **HTTPS & Security** - Encrypted data transfer and secure credential management

- **Monitoring & Observability** - Performance tracking and system health monitoring## Learn More

### Run Tests Locally
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```
